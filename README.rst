This repository is divided into two distinct sections. 

- The flowgnn_opamps folder contains the code for the experiments on the CktBench-101 dataset from Dong et al. (2023) (Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16406, Code: https://github.com/zehao-dong/CktGNN). 
- The flowgnn_powergraph folder contains the code for the experiments on the PowerGraph dataset from Varbella et al. (2024) (Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02827, Code: https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets/PowerGraph-Graph).
